<header><h6>What Username should I use?</h6></header>
<p class="indent">You can have any choice of username, it doesn’t have to be related to your system logon name.<br>
Try to avoid easily guessed usernames like Admin, Administrator, System, or Root.</p>

<p class="indent">You can remove the password by manually editing the /etc/notrack/notrack.conf Delete the lines starting “Username” and “Password”</p>

<header><h6>What is Delay?</h6></header>
<p class="indent">Every single password can be cracked, the only thing that will save your password is time – a sufficiently complex password could take months / years / decades to crack. Unfortunately as more and more companies have been hacked and their users details spread around the Internet, the hacking community have learned that most people chose simplistic passwords, e.g. 12345, or qwerty.<br>
These common passwords have been placed into a dictionary, therefore if your password appears in a dictionary it could be guessed in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p class="indent">One method of combating this threat is to impose a delay between checking passwords.<br>
NoTrack allows a custom delay between 5 to 1800 seconds (30 minutes) between password guessing attempts.<br>
Even a short delay makes it very hard for a dictionary attack to be feasible.</p>

<header><h6>Can I use with Fail2ban?</h6></header>
<p class="indent">Yes, NoTrack writes a log of failed password attempts into <code>/var/log/ntrk-admin.log</code></p>

<header><h6>Can I have more than one account?</h6></header>
<p class="indent">No, the complexity dramatically increases to add multiple accounts, and at this point it  is not a feature I'm prepared to add.</p>
